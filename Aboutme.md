About me  and my project 
A management consultant and executive coach by profession , motorcyclist by passion with a love for travel. Through my travels I aim to experience our rich heritage and culture. There is so much to see and experience in India, it would take a few lifetimes to visit every part of the country .
During my rides I found the highways unsafe for motorcycles , weather too warm for riding and accommodation inadequate. In order to bridge this gap I plan to build a camper van that is self sufficient to live comfortably and can carry my motorcycle ( for me to explore off beat paths).
The vehicle will have provisions to make meals , sleep and bathe comfortably. It will also have a garage for my bike.

As I embark upon this journey of bringing this project to life , the only challenge I have, is that, I do not have a clue of carpentry, electrical, electronics, fabrication and design â€¦but there is hope having enrolled for Skill ed at Workbench project . I intend to learn as  I build and hopefully complete my dream project at the end of the course..
