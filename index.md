# Welcome to the campervan build page - Papillion - Arvind Nachaya

## About me  and my project :

A management consultant and executive coach by profession , motorcyclist by passion with a love for travel. Through my travels I aim to experience our rich heritage and culture. There is so much to see and experience in India, it would take a few lifetimes to visit every part of the country .
During my rides I found the highways unsafe for motorcycles , weather too warm for riding and accommodation inadequate. In order to bridge this gap I plan to build a camper van that is self sufficient to live comfortably and can carry my motorcycle ( for me to explore off beat paths).
The vehicle will have provisions to make meals , sleep and bathe comfortably. It will also have a garage for my bike.

As I embark upon this journey of bringing this project to life , the only challenge I have, is that, I do not have a clue of carpentry, electrical, electronics, fabrication and design â€¦but there is hope having enrolled for Skill ed at Workbench project . I intend to learn as  I build and hopefully complete my dream project at the end of the course..


The goal is to build a recreational vehicle (RV) on a tempo traveller platform ( Force motors ). The RV will be fitted with a kitchenette cum wash area, Wet-room with chemical / composting toilet, Sofa cum bed, Fold down bed, Motorcycle or E bike storage, motorised ramp for loading and unloading, office work space, storage for food / clothes and accessories. In order to manage these facilities the follwing are required - running water (Cold and hot), Sofa cum bed, Mechinical loader for motorcycle, power - Solar / inverter, smart lighting, storage cabinets, power management, gas indicators etc.

## The project includes learning the foll skills :
1. Electrical 
2. Electronics 
3. Carpentry 
4. Fabrication 
5. And a few more 

# Week 1 
The first week was dedicated to learn how to use 2D and 3D software . Given my project I focussewd on building skill on Sketch up. As a part of the learning series I have made 3D models and cutting plans for Garden bench and a small shelf. That gave me confidence in building a rough visual of my Camper van project.

## Small Shellf 
The goal was to design and represent a basic 3D shelf

## Camper table with cutting plan
The 3rd design was to build a camper table with a cutting plan and upload to 3D wearehouse ... the objective was to make a viable product design with accutrate mesurements and geometry.
